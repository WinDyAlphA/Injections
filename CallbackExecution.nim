#[

Code execution using callback function.
Source : https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/OffensiveNim/blob/master/src/shellcode_callback_bin.nim
Steps : 
1. Allocate memory in the current process as RW.
2. Write shellcode to the allocated memory.
3. Change memory protection to RX.
4. Using a callback function that points to the allocated memory (EnumSystemGeoID for example).
